Parallel-tree-search.

1. build artifact
2. compile pts.xc
3. run it



Check that some extensions pass the MDA and that their examples run



## From the extension developer's perspective

writing an extension is not something that can just be done

maybe a tour of some files - looking at syntax and semantics

then how the make files work


Go look at somethings in the appendix ...

artifact doesn't contain all extensions - this is OK



we are missing the construction DSL ....
